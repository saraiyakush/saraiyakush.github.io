# Kush Saraiya

*Software Consultant Â· Bridge Between Product & Tech Â· Mentor*

I help product leaders and engineering teams bridge the gap between business goals and technology. Over the last 17 years, I've learned that success isn't just about writing code â€” it's about making complexity simple, human, and actionable.


## What Drives Me

- Explaining technical concepts in laymanâ€™s terms so decisions are informed and inclusive.
- Partnering with leaders and teams to align architecture with real business outcomes.
- Leading, mentoring, and enabling engineers to grow.
- Sharing knowledge and giving back to the community.

## Beyond Consulting

Iâ€™m passionate about solving real-world problems â€” though I believe my best work on that front is still ahead of me.
Data privacy and consent are my top priorities when assessing any product or service.

I aspire to educate non-technical people about technology and its impact â€” especially how their data is used.
