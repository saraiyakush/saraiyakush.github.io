# Kush Saraiya

*Engineer, mentor, and software consultant shaped by years of building systems, guiding teams, and translating tech into clarity.*

I turn technical depth into real-world insight — helping teams create better products today, while inspiring the next generation to truly understand technology, and life beyond it.


## What Drives Me

- Explaining technical concepts in layman's terms so decisions are informed and inclusive.
- Partnering with leaders and teams to align architecture with real business outcomes.
- Leading, mentoring, and enabling engineers to grow.
- Sharing knowledge and giving back to the community.


## Beyond Consulting

I'm passionate about solving real-world problems — though I believe my best work on that front is still ahead of me.
Data privacy and user consent are my top priorities when assessing any product or service.

I aspire to educate non-technical people about technology and its impact — especially how their data is used.
